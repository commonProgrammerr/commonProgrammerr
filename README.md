### Hi, I'm André

I'm a Brazilian Computer Engineering student focused on embedded systems and low-level development. I work on building reliable software for hardware, from custom Linux distributions to firmware development.

### Things I work with

Languages: 
  - C/C++ (my comfort zone)
  - Python (for everything else)
  - Rust (currently learning!)
  - Shell Scripting (automation magic)

Tools & Platforms:
  - Git (obviously 😄)
  - Yocto Project (my current obsession)
  - GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
  - Snapcraft (for packaging)


### Learning & Growing

- **Computer Engineering @ Universidade de Pernambuco** (graduating 2026)
- **Python Course @ Linuxtips** – 66 hours of Python goodness
- **Constantly learning** – Currently diving deeper into Rust and robotics!
